# Old Server Code
  Unused code I wrote for various Lambda Gaming Gmod servers that I keep around in case I want to reuse them in the future. Inside each script or folder, I added comments that describe the state of the script, what it did, and why it was removed. I did this mainly to help identify scripts and to know what changes I need to make if I ever want to reuse them. Below is the list of states a script can be in.

1. Finished: The script is finished and was in working condition at the time of removal.

2. Working: The script is unfinished but was in mostly working condition at the time of removal.

3. Unfinished: The script is unfinished and not working for the most part at the time of removal.

4. Broken: The script is finished but was not working at the time of removal.
