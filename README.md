# Old Server Code
 Old code that was made for a Lambda Gaming server but is no longer in use. Inside each script or folder, I added comments that describe the state of the script, what it did, and why it was removed. I did this mainly to know what changes I need to make, if any, if I ever want to reuse a script from here. Below is the list of states a script can be in.

1. Finished: The script is finished and was in working condition the last time it was used.

2. Working: The script is unfinished but was in mostly working condition the last time it was used.

3. Unfinished: The script is unfinished and not working for the most part, but some functions were still in working condition the last time it was used.

3. Broken: The script is completely broken and was not working at all the last time it was used.
