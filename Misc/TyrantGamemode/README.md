State: Unfinished

Description: This is a gamemode for Gmod that a friend and I were working on. It was meant to be a combination of Resident Evil 2's characters and spookiness with Left 4 Dead's versus gameplay. It was made to run off of DarkRP as a test and was eventually supposed to be moved over to it's own gamemode.

Reason for Removal: Development was slow and had a lower priority over other servers at the time, and when we finally had time to work on it again, Capcom released a trailer for their new game that was like this one but 10 times better, so we're just gonna play that instead of making this lol.
