State: Finished, Working, and Unoptimized

Description: This is a collection of ship part entities that were used on the old Clone Wars RP server. The ship parts were used, as you may have guessed, on a Star Wars ship map. They have the ability to be damaged and repaired via the entity repair tool. Once their health reaches 0, they will explode, catch fire, and turn black.

Reason for Removal: The addon got removed when the Clone Wars RP server shut down.
