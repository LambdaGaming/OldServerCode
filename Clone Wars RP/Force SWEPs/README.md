State: Finished

Description: This is a collection of force SWEPs separated from Rubat's Star Wars Lighstaber SWEP, so credits to him for the main functions of these weapons. They perform the same as they would if you were to use them through the original Lightsaber SWEP, these are just separated to allow players to use them without needing to hold a lightsaber.

Reason for Removal: This addon was removed when the Clone Wars RP server went down.
