State: Unfinished

Description: This was a planned system for CityRP that would allow players to steal unowned vehicles from the car dealer and take them to the smuggle NPC for a profit. Depending on how much the stolen vehicle was worth, players could be wanted by the police during the lockpick, after the lockpick, or after the vehicle was sold. This system was also planned to have a side feature of renting out the vehicles instead of stealing them. As long as the player could afford to keep paying the rental fees, they could keep the car until they disconnect or the server closes.

Reason for Removal: This system wasn't really removed since it was part of a planned update that never happened, but it was never added since I could never get the rental and stealing menus to work together. On top of that, there were also performance concerns since the vehicle models on the server aren't precached to save loading times. Every time a new vehicle would spawn, it would cause the server to freeze for a few seconds, which could get annoying very fast if a gang stole and sold all three cars from the dealer at the same time.
