State: Finished and Working

Description: This is a hunting system originally made for CityRP that goes pretty in-depth. Deer would spawn at random locations in the map, and the player who killed them would have the choice of taking the deer's head as a trophy or cutting up the deer meet to sell to the cook, which the cook can then cook into edible deer meat.

Reason for Removal: Deer NPCs couldn't roam or run when shot without propper AI nodes, which none of the maps on CityRP had.
