State: Broken

Description: Originally made for CityRP and later added to HLU RP, this system was designed to allow the mayor/administrator to broadcast their voice through speakers that they would setup around the map.

Reason for Removal: Never worked properly and it wasn't worth the effort to try to fix it after multiple previous attempts. There were also some game limitations that prevented the broadcasting player's voice from being realistically heard. Voice cannot be broadcast from entities in 3D space unless that entity is the speaking player.
